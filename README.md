# RAG-with-speech-recognition

The goal of this project is to improve RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) models by 
utilising the most recent developments in multilingual speech recognition technology. Using 
pre-trained models such as Multilingual Whisper, our aim is to develop a system that can 
handle speech in various languages without requiring additional training. Our goal in 
accomplishing this is to make it possible for RAG to smoothly execute operations like 
translation, summarization, and speech recognition across several languages.
